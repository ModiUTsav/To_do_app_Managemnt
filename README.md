To-Do App with Authentication
This is a full-stack to-do application built with a Flask backend, a React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database. It features user authentication with JWT tokens, Google single sign-on (SSO), and email notifications for new to-do items.

The project is structured with two main directories: backend/ for the Flask API and frontend/ for the React web application.

Backend: Flask API
The backend is a RESTful API built with Python and Flask.

Tech Stack
Framework: Flask

Database: PostgreSQL (for production), SQLite (for local development)

ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy

Authentication: Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-Dance (for Google OAuth)

Email: Flask-Mail

Deployment: Gunicorn

Local Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file with the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

# Database URL for local development (or use a PostgreSQL URL)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///todo.db

# JWT Secret Key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key

# Google OAuth credentials
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Email credentials (for Flask-Mail)
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password

Run the Flask application:

flask run

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Frontend: React App
The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React.

Tech Stack
Framework: React

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Routing: React Router

API Client: Axios

Local Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file for any frontend-specific environment variables. Note that this app's API client is hardcoded to a local URL, but you can use an environment variable to switch between local and production URLs.

VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000

Run the React application:

npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

Deployment on Render
This application is designed to be deployed on Render as two separate services: a Web Service for the backend and a Static Site for the frontend.

Backend Deployment Steps
Create a PostgreSQL Database on Render.

Create a new Web Service for your backend.

Connect your GitHub repository.

Configuration:

Root Directory: backend

Environment: Python 3

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: gunicorn -w 4 "app:app"

Environment Variables: Add the variables from your .env file, using the PostgreSQL connection string provided by Render for DATABASE_URL.

Frontend Deployment Steps
Create a new Static Site for your frontend.

Connect your GitHub repository.

Configuration:

Root Directory: frontend

Build Command: npm run build

Publish Directory: build

Update API URL: After your backend is deployed and you have its public URL (e.g., https://your-flask-app.onrender.com), remember to update the baseURL in frontend/src/api.js before pushing the code for the frontend deployment.
